============

Schedule the sharing of tools among various organizations.

This is a fork of MRBS by @DanDanowski and @SvenTechie at the Cornell Center for Materials Research and was funded through a grant from the National Science Foundation. It was released as open source by permission of Mitchell Collinsworth. You may use it under the same license as MRBS.

Hopefully more updates will follow. Please excuse our dust.

### Overview

The intention of this fork was to allow the scheduling of tools / instruments located in a particular room / facility. The facilities belong to organizations (centers) that share the resources.
